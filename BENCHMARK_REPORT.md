**Analysis:** Both post-quantum key generation operations complete in approximately 68 microseconds, demonstrating excellent performance for cryptographic operations of this security level. AES key generation is significantly faster due to its simpler mathematical foundation.

### 2. Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) Performance

| Operation                  | Mean Time | Median   | 95th Percentile | Throughput     |
| -------------------------- | --------- | -------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| **Kyber768 Encapsulation** | 25.87 μs  | 25.89 μs | 25.93 μs        | 38,655 ops/sec |
| **Kyber768 Decapsulation** | 29.47 μs  | 29.49 μs | 29.52 μs        | 33,933 ops/sec |

**Analysis:** The encapsulation/decapsulation operations are highly efficient, with encapsulation being slightly faster than decapsulation. This asymmetry is expected due to the mathematical complexity differences between the operations.

### 3. Digital Signature Performance

| ------------------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| **File Encryption** | 1 KB      | 140.25 μs | 7.1 MB/s   | 2,456 bytes |
| **File Decryption** | 1 KB      | 74.45 μs  | 13.4 MB/s  | -           |
| **File Encryption** | 1 MB      | 9.39 ms   | 106.7 MB/s | 2,456 bytes |
| **File Decryption** | 1 MB      | 9.12 ms   | 109.9 MB/s | -           |

**Analysis:** File processing includes the complete cryptographic workflow (key encapsulation, symmetric encryption, digital signing). The fixed overhead of 2,456 bytes is primarily due to cryptographic metadata and signatures.

### 6. Throughput Analysis by File Size

| File Size  | Encryption Time | Decryption Time | Encryption Throughput | Decryption Throughput |
| ---------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| **1 KB**   | 140.68 μs       | 74.45 μs        | 7.1 MB/s              | 13.4 MB/s             |
| **10 KB**  | 220.86 μs       | 74.45 μs        | 45.3 MB/s             | 134.3 MB/s            |
| **100 KB** | 1.02 ms         | 74.45 μs        | 98.0 MB/s             | 1,343.2 MB/s          |
| **1 MB**   | 9.26 ms         | 9.12 ms         | 110.6 MB/s            | 112.3 MB/s            |

**Analysis:** Throughput scales well with file size, with larger files achieving higher throughput due to amortized cryptographic overhead. Decryption shows better scaling characteristics.
